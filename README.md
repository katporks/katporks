### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kat Olaguer, a Full Stack Developer with experience in creative coding, web development, and building AI-powered tools ðŸŒ± Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. [Creative Coding](https://github.com/katporks/creative-coding) - In the exhibition "atop remembering" thoughtfully curated by Amelia Earhart at New Westminster's Arrietta Art Gallery, I showcased creative coding projects inspired by my memories of growing up between Manila and Vancouver. The exhibition highlighted the intersection of art and technology, and my projects were displayed as interactive installations. I created interactive prototypes and showcased the completed works [here](https://atop-remembering.web.app). Guests at the exhibition had the opportunity to engage with the pieces and experience the fusion of art and coding.

2. [I-Cue](https://github.com/edgarcoime/i-cue) - I-Cue is our [first-place winning submission for StormHacks 2022](https://devpost.com/software/i-cue?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress), a global hackathon organized by SFU Surge. Our project also won Most Creative Use of Github for our use of Github's best practices. I designed I-Cue's answering system using OpenAI and a custom algorithm that matches inputs to a list of contextual keywords. Additionally, I implemented the front-end for the card inputs.

3. [Snake Battle Royale](https://github.com/BCIT-Snake-Battle-Royale/snake) - As a final project for a programming paradigms course, I led a team of 15 in developing a nostalgic ode to the classic Snake game. I designed the game flow through a user sequence diagram, implemented networking using Socket.IO, and utilized technologies like Node.js, JavaScript, Rust, and WebAssembly.

These projects showcase my skills in Node.js, JavaScript, p5.js, WebGL, HTML5, CSS, TypeScript, Firebase, React, Next.js, Rust, WebAssembly, and more.
